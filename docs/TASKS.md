    - Implement basic enemy spawning
    - Add simple movement AI

12. **Implement Enemy AI**
    - Make enemies target the player
    - Add enemy shooting logic
    - Implement random movement patterns

13. **Add Collision Detection**
    - Create collision helpers
    - Implement projectile-tank collisions
    - Add damage system

14. **Add Health System**
    - Implement player and enemy health
    - Create health bars
    - Add game over condition

## Environment and Obstacles

15. **Create Map Boundaries**
    - Add invisible walls at canvas edges
    - Implement collision with boundaries

16. **Add Obstacles**
    - Create obstacle entities
    - Generate random obstacles
    - Implement collision with obstacles

17. **Make Destructible Obstacles**
    - Add health to obstacles
    - Implement damage from projectiles
    - Add destruction effects

## UI and Game States

18. **Create Start Menu**
    - Design start menu UI
    - Add game instructions
    - Implement start button

19. **Add Game Over Screen**
    - Create game over UI
    - Show final score
    - Add restart functionality

20. **Implement Score System**
    - Add score for destroying enemies
    - Create high score tracking with localStorage
    - Display current score during gameplay

## Polish and Extras

21. **Add Sound Effects**
    - Create a sound manager
    - Add sound effects for firing, explosions, etc.
    - Implement background music
    - Add mute functionality

22. **Implement Power-ups**
    - Create power-up entities
    - Add different power-up types (health, speed, etc.)
    - Implement power-up effects
    - Add visual indicators for active power-ups

23. **Add Visual Polish**
    - Improve tank and projectile rendering
    - Add simple particle effects
    - Enhance UI with animations

24. **Performance Optimization**
    - Implement entity pooling for projectiles
    - Optimize collision detection
    - Ensure smooth performance on mobile

## Testing and Deployment

25. **Test Game Mechanics**
    - Verify all game features work as expected
    - Test on different browsers
    - Ensure mobile compatibility

26. **Deploy to Vercel**
    - Build the project for production
    - Deploy to Vercel
    - Verify the deployment works correctly

## Implementation Order

This task list is designed to be implemented in roughly the order presented. However, there are a few dependencies to be aware of:

- The Canvas component (Task 4) must be completed before most other tasks
- Input handling (Task 6) is required for movement and shooting
- Collision detection (Task 13) is needed for obstacles and combat
- The game state system should be in place before implementing menus

When working on these tasks, refer to the detailed implementation guide for specific code examples and guidance for each task.
