# Tank Game Implementation Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of how the game is structured and how the different components work together.

## Project Architecture

The game is built using Next.js with TypeScript and uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering. The main components are:

1. **Game State Management**: Centralized state tracked in the `GameContainer` component
2. **Rendering System**: Canvas-based rendering with frame-by-frame updates
3. **Input Handling**: Keyboard and mouse input captured with custom hooks
4. **Game Logic**: Entity updates, collision detection, and game rules
5. **Sound System**: Audio playback for game events

## Implementation Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Next.js app bootstraps
   - Game container mounts and initializes the canvas
   - Game enters the start menu state
   - Initial game state is prepared

2. **Game Loop**:
   - The main game loop runs at 60 FPS using setInterval
   - Each frame:
     - Process player input
     - Update all entity positions
     - Check for collisions
     - Update game state (scores, health, etc.)
     - Render the current frame

3. **Entity Management**:
   - Player tank controlled by keyboard/mouse
   - Enemy tanks spawn at intervals
   - Projectiles created when firing
   - Power-ups appear periodically
   - Obstacles generated at game start

4. **Collision System**:
   - Simple circular collision detection for most entities
   - Rectangular collision for obstacles
   - Different collision responses based on entity types

5. **Game States**:
   - Start Menu: Display instructions and high score
   - Playing: Main game loop active
   - Game Over: Display score and restart option

## Key Files and Their Responsibilities

- `src/components/game/GameContainer.tsx`: Main component managing the game
- `src/components/game/Canvas.tsx`: Handles canvas rendering
- `src/components/game/StartMenu.tsx`: Displays the start menu UI
- `src/hooks/useInput.ts`: Captures and processes user input
- `src/lib/enemies.ts`: Logic for enemy tank creation and AI
- `src/lib/obstacles.ts`: Generates the game map obstacles
- `src/lib/powerups.ts`: Manages power-up generation and effects
- `src/lib/sounds.ts`: Controls game sound effects
- `src/types/game.ts`: Type definitions for all game entities

## State Management

The game uses React's useState for state management. The main state object includes:

```typescript
{
  player: Tank,              // Player tank properties
  enemies: Tank[],           // List of enemy tanks
  projectiles: Projectile[], // All active projectiles
  obstacles: Obstacle[],     // Map obstacles
  powerUps: PowerUp[],       // Active power-ups
  score: number,             // Current score
  isGameOver: boolean,       // Game state flag
  isPaused: boolean,         // Pause state flag
  powerUpEffects: {          // Active effects
    speed: number,
    shield: boolean,
    rapidFire: boolean
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
   - Filtering inactive entities for efficient updates
   - Using simple collision detection for performance

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Touch events for mobile compatibility
   - Responsive canvas sizing for different devices
   - Audio handling with fallbacks

3. **Deployment**:
   - Static export for Vercel deployment
   - Asset optimization for production

4. **Possible Extensions**:
   - Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
   - Additional power-up types
   - Improved graphics with sprite animations
   - Multiplayer support
